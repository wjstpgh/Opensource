## **Welcome to Opensource Python Web Crawling!** 

Basically, a web crawler that people know is a computer program that explores the World Wide Web in an organized and automated way. The program we're trying to create is to create a crawler in a way that users type in to find the information they want. Our program is free and anyone can use it.
